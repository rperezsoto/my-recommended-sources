Intro
-----

This repo only contains python talks that I have seen and somehow I recommend, 
either as a basic python knowledge, advanced/detailed, or simply amusing talks.

It also contains references to Blogs I have read and found useful as well as 
Books or other sources.

   Future change: I will move some sections to different files to make it easier
   to add new info. For now this is good enough. 


Disclaimer
----------

This is my personal preference, you may not like the talks,
may like talks that I dislike, may find boring talks that I find interesting or 
may disagree with how I classify things, and that is ok. I 
made the repo public just in case it is useful to another one.

the book and expect the second edition to be even better... but I 
just can't stay awake during his talks. All the ones I have seen, were of 
chapters or information that was in the first book. Feel free to try his talks,
