Intro
-----

This repo only contains python talks that I have seen and somehow I recommend, 
either as a basic python knowledge, advanced/detailed, or simply amusing talks.

It also contains references to Blogs I have read and found usefull as well as 
Books or other sources 

Compulsory talks

Compulsory Books
----------------

O'Reilly, Luciano Ramalho `Fluent Python <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/>`_ 
*Changed my life, it is a mid-level python book. Read it after some functional 
programming with python and doing your first 2-3 programms*

O'Reilly, Luciano Ramalho `Fluent Python [2nd Ed] <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/>`_
*(Did not read it but Should be even better)*

*Side note: I can't stand Luciano's talks. I think he did an incredible job with
the book and expect the second edition to be even better... but I 
just can't stay awake during his talks. All the ones I have seen, were of 
chapters or information that was in the first book. Feel free to try his talks, 
the info is great. It might be just me that gets bored in the talks*
